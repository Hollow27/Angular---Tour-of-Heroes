<h2>My Heroes</h2>
<ul class="heroes">

  <!--*ngFor is Angulars repeater directive. It repeats the host element for each
  element in a list -->
  <li *ngFor="let hero of heroes">
    <span class="badge">{{hero.id}}</span> {{hero.name}}
  </li>
</ul>




<!--Updated the binding in the template to announce the hero's component-name
and show both id and name in a details layout like this: -->

<h2>{{ hero.name | uppercase }} Details</h2>
<div><span>id: </span>{{hero.id}}</div>
<div><span>name: </span>{{hero.name}}</div>

<!--Users should be able to edit the hero name in an <input> textbox.
The textbox should both display the hero's name property and update that
property as the user types. That means data flow from the component class
out to the screen back to the class.

To automate the data flow, we need to setup a two-way data binding between
the <input> form element and the hero.name property.-->
<div>
  <label>name:
    <input [(ngModel)]="hero.name" placeholder="name">
  </label>
</div>

<!--[{ngModel}] is Angulars two-way data binding syntax. Shown above
it binds the hero.name property to the HTML textbox so that data can dlow in
both directions: from the hero.name property to the textbox, and from the textbox
back to the hero.name.-->
